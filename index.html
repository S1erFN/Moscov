            <p>
         Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation, the country's largest and one of the world's most important political, industrial, scientific and cultural centers. Moscow is located in the European part of Russia, between the Oka and Volga rivers, on the Moscow River. The population of the Russian capital is about 10.5 million inhabitants. From the 13th century it became the center of an appanage principality, in the 14th century - the capital city of North-Eastern Russia, and from the end of the 15th century the capital of the united Russian state. With the transfer of the capital of Russia to St. Petersburg (1712), Moscow retained the significance of the second capital. On March 12, 1918, the city became the capital of the RSFSR, in 1922-1991 - the USSR, from 1991 - the Russian Federation.
